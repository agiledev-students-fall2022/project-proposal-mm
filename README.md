### What and why?

Tracking our daily tasks is important in order to achieve both our short-term and long-term goals. In this semester, I'd like to build an easy-to-use application to track our personal to-do-lists and tasks. While this is not at all a new idea and there has been dozens of similar applications already launched, I find all task-tracking applications I've tried to be efficiency limiting in some aspects. Some apps have hard-to-use designs, some apps have an overwhelmingly complicated structure, some apps are way too annoying with frequent reminders that I just want to turn them off, etc. I, therefore, hope to build a visually appealing, simple application to track our tasks with unprecedented ease and efficiency. Hopefully it can make accomplishing tasks fun. This is important because if done right, it can help us reduce a huge amount of stress and time commitment in managing our tasks and focus on completing them instead. 

### For whom?

This software is built for anybody--students, professors, business analysts, househusbands/housewives... As long as the person has a goal he/she hopes to achive or a task he/she hopes to finish, either short-term or long-term, this app will be useful for them since it can help them improve their productivity and efficiency. 

### How?

This application will allow users to track their daily, weekly, monthly, and annual tasks. Users will be able to modify, manage, and visualize them in an easy, simple way.

### Scope

The app is a fairly simple and straightforward program--it won't involve a complicated structure, a complex logical flow, nor a detailed design. However, it isn't overly simple since careful design of the logic is crucial for the success of the product. I anticipate that a team of 4-6 programmers will be able to finish the software in around 2 months, making it perfect for the work of one semester.
